	Integration Solutions form the backbone of many modern enterprises, linking vital systems and business processes and any defect in the integration layer is likely to cause huge loss and affect many areas of the enterprise. 
	It is no wonder that majority of the integration solutions are done with minimal or no testing at all and integration flows developed using Mule are no exception. 
	The process, standards and guidelines defined in this section and the sub sections provision the means to perform Mocking, Unit Testing, Test Suite Creation, Integration Testing of Mule projects using MUnit
